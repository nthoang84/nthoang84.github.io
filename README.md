# Academic Websites for Hoang Nguyen

This repository contains the academic website for Hoang Nguyen.

## Documentation

The website is a [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) website. It uses the [PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod), modified in various ways (by [Pascal Michaillat](https://pascalmichaillat.org/d5/)) to be more minimalist and more adapted to academic websites. The website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages).

The template is documented at https://pascalmichaillat.org/d5/.
